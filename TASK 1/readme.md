🛡️ TASK 1 – Web Application Vulnerability Assessment (DWAV)
Cyber Security Internship – Future Interns
📌 Task Overview

In this task, we performed a Web Application Vulnerability Assessment (DWAV) on a target web app using Kali Linux tools.
The objective was to understand basic security testing workflow, discover vulnerabilities, and document the findings.

🧰 Tools & Environment Used

Kali Linux (VirtualBox)

OWASP ZAP (CLI-based usage)

MariaDB (installed for database-related tasks)

Basic Linux commands

Browser for accessing target web app

✔️ What We Completed in TASK 1
1. Environment Setup

Installed Kali Linux on VirtualBox

Ensured networking was configured correctly

Installed required tools (MariaDB, ZAP, basic utilities)

2. Running OWASP ZAP (Through Command Line)

You learned how to:

Start ZAP from terminal

Run scans on target URLs

Understand the basic CLI flags

Generate basic output

3. Reconnaissance & Scanning

We performed:

Active Scan

Passive Scan

Spider/Crawl

Alert identification

These helped us detect:

Missing security headers

Outdated components

Cleartext communication

Input fields vulnerable to XSS or SQLi (if present)

4. Understanding Vulnerabilities

We walked through:

What security warnings mean

How ZAP categorizes risk levels

Why each issue matters in real-world exploitation
